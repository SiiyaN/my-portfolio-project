            with SheCodes. With a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Information
            Technology and Management, I bring a strong foundation in tech and
            business to my development journey. I thrive on new challenges and
            I'm always eager to be part of the solution, blending creativity and
            problem-solving in their work. Whether it's designing responsive
            websites or learning the latest in web technologies, I am dedicated
